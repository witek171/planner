---

## About The Project

This project provides a comprehensive and flexible backend solution designed to power scheduling and management applications for a wide variety of service-based businesses. Its universal architecture makes it suitable for organizations like:

- Sports clubs: managing class schedules, booking courts or facilities, and assigning trainers.

- Medical clinics: scheduling patient appointments, managing doctor availability, and handling patient records.

- Wellness centers: booking spa treatments, yoga classes, or consultations.

- Any business that relies on managing appointments, staff availability, and client reservations.

The API is built to handle complex relationships between companies (or locations), staff members, available services (events), and clients (participants), providing a robust foundation for a custom-tailored front-end application.
